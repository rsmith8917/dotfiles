Let's begin development of the feature defined in FEATURE-PLAN.md and FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md by following a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

Follow these steps:
1. Review FEATURE-PLAN.md and FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md
2. For each test layer outlined in the FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md (unit, integration, e2e, etc) follow these steps:
  a. Develop the tests outlined in FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md
  b. Stub out any application code necessary to get the tests to run (but not pass)
  c. Run the tests and verify that they fail
  d. Double check that all outlined test cases in FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md are covered
