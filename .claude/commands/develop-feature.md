Let's complete development of the feature defined in FEATURE-PLAN.md and FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md by following a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

Follow these steps:
1. Review FEATURE-PLAN.md and FEATURE-TESTING-PLAN.md
2. Develop application code to make the tests pass
3. Check if the code implementation needs any cleanup or light refactoring. If so, do it.
4. Check that the code implementation includes any additional wiring or application level concerns that may have been missed by the tests.
